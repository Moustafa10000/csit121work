                <p>I learned the basics of HTML and how it can be used to create simple web sites. 
                    It looked unclear at first, but once I put headings, paragraphs, and lists, it got easier. 
                    I also learned how to add links to other websites, making the page more useful. 
                    Making this page showed me that even small steps can result in something that looks good on the web.</p>

                <p>CSS taught me how to use it to style web pages and made it look cool. 
                    i now know how to style some elements use class and ID selectors.
                    including using colors, font styles. and spacing, to make the website look cool. i had some problems when i started working with CSS, but with practice, i could now done it good.
                    i attempted with several colors and this project shows how CSS is important for webpage's apperance.</p>

                <h2>lab 05 Reflection</h2>
                <p>It taught me how to build a simple responsive page without using difficult code.    
                    I started with a single column and then used a media query to show multiple columns on bigger screens.   
                    I sure that the menu links went to the correct section and reviewed my file paths to make sure that nothing broken.   
                    I worked on best practices such as clear headings, strong contrast, and short lines of text.  
                    I validated my work using the W3C validator and class notes..</p>
