                <h2>Reflection on what i learned about CSS</h2>
                <p>CSS taught me how to use it to style web pages and made it look cool.
                    i now know how to style some elements use class and ID selectors.
                    including using colors, font styles. and spacing, to make the website look cool.
                    i had some problems when i started working with CSS, but with practice, i could now done it good.
                    i attempted with several colors and this project shows how CSS is important for webpage's apperance.
